# React - To Do List
## Introduction
This project implements the Front-End for a simple To-Do List web application, using the **React JS** library, and also **Styled Components replacing pure CSS**.<br/>
It includes the login page and the general UI of the app. <br/>
The login authentication logic and the tasks database for each user **are not implemented**, since this project aims to be a **Front-End study only**.

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript replacing CSS
- JavaScript 
- Ajax
- SASS
- Node.js

## Demonstration

https://github.com/Behzad-Rajabalipour/Several-Small-Projects/assets/115672803/3a101c70-da74-4987-a9e1-b8636817217a

## Features
• Login page, including Sign In button, which redirects to the main application; <br/>
• Application UI with navigation sidebar and area for the to-do list; <br/>
• Add new task, setting name and categorie properties; <br/>
• Delete task, with a modal for confirming the action; <br/>
• Check task as done via checkbox; <br/>
• Filter tasks showing in the to-do list by "done", "not done" or "all"; <br/>
• Filter tasks showing in the to-do list by their categorie, via selecting on the sidebar; <br/>
• Authorization: user cannot access home page before login, neither login page after logged. <br/>

**Note**: The functionalities for "edit task" and adding or removing categories are currently not implemented. These features were not included because they were deemed to be less beneficial for my personal learning and would require a significant amount of time. They may be added in the future.
